            <br>R3. Source port is the sending application. Destination port is the recieving app. 
            <br> So, if source port = x and destination port = y from Host A to Host B, 
            <br>then source port = y and destination port = x from Host B to Host A.

          <br>R4. Describe why an application developer might choose to run an application over UDP rather than TCP.
      </li>

      <li class = "uppgift">
        <br>R5. Why is it that voice and video traffic is often sent over TCP rather than UDP in today’s Internet?
        (Hint: The answer we are looking for has nothing to do with TCP’s congestion-control mechanism.)
    </li>

    <li class = "uppgift">
      <br>R6. Is it possible for an application to enjoy reliable data transfer even when the application runs over UDP? 
      If so, how?
  </li>

  <li class = "uppgift">
    <br>R7. Suppose a process in Host C has a UDP socket with port number 6789.
    Suppose both Host A and Host B each send a UDP segment to Host C with destination port number 6789.
     Will both of these segments be directed to the same socket at Host C?
      If so, how will the process at Host C know that these two segments originated from two different hosts?
</li>

<li class = "uppgift">
  <br>R8. Suppose that a Web server runs in Host C on port 80. Suppose this Web server uses persistent connections, 
  and is currently receiving requests from two different Hosts, A and B. Are all of the requests being sent through 
  the same socket at Host C? If they are being passed through different sockets, do both of the sockets have port 80? 
  Discuss and explain.
